* Select your failed sequences.

* Select the "Biocode" icon on the toolbar and then "Mark as FAIL in LIMS".

* Uncheck "Also attach raw traces to sequencing reaction in LIMS".

* Fill in the "Reason Details" and "Notes" fields with any relevant information.

* Keep the Consensus sequence settings at their default, and press "OK" for operation to run.
